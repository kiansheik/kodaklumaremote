# Work log

- 2026-10-18: Read attached mission. Workspace has no existing Git repository or
  agent docs. Initialized baseline notes. Web fetch of target unavailable;
  independent HTTP and clean-browser reconnaissance pending.
- 2026-10-18: Confirmed public reachability outside sandbox; inspected hashed
  frontend assets. Existing native Cast and same-origin embed/source flow found.
  Both clean headless Chromium and headed Chrome reproduced console clearing and
  eventual `about:blank`; no detector bypass or DRM/auth modification used.
- 2026-10-18: Implemented local-code-only MV3 fallback, shared CAF adapter/media
  extraction, deterministic fixtures and HTTPS public demo. Unit/browser checks
  found and fixed hidden-host CSS, source-change races, lost disconnect errors,
  wrong-episode position restoration, and BFCache lifecycle issues.
- 2026-10-18 07:15 America/Sao_Paulo: Live Google SDK initialized on HTTPS demo
  with native Cast enabled. Default Playwright disables MediaRouter; local HTTP
  SDK resources were blocked. Final smoke used a managed ephemeral Chrome profile,
  HTTPS and exact removal of the pinned Playwright disabled-features switch.
- 2026-10-18 07:18–07:20 America/Sao_Paulo: Actual-origin probe confirmed extension
  execution in watch/embed, but blanking preceded video/control appearance.
  Final build +25 unit +15 loaded-MV3 browser tests passed. HTTPS SDK smoke was
  repeated successfully with no selected device or media requests. Updated public
  demo from403 sample to current official200 MP4. Handoff and device checklist
  completed; physical receiver acceptance remains outstanding.
