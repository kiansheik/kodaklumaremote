# Current state

2026-10-18: New repository; original empty `headers.txt` preserved. Public frontend
inspection and two clean automated browser baselines are complete. The site is a
React SPA with same-origin `/embed/` HTML5/hls.js playback and **existing native
Cast code**. `disable-devtool` clears the console and can navigate to
`about:blank`; both baselines reproduced clearing/blanking, but the detector and
manual DevTools/extension-fingerprinting reports remain unisolated.

Implementation exists in the working tree: bundled MAIN-world MV3 fallback using
only the page's existing CAF SDK; same-origin frames; declared HTTP media sources;
remote controls; navigation/load cancellation/cleanup. Preserve visible native
Cast UI. A separate ordinary HTTPS demo uses the same controller with a public
Big Buck Bunny MP4. No SDK injection, relay, auth/DRM bypass, telemetry, or media
bundling is part of the extension.

Checks so far: 25 unit tests passed; 14 loaded-MV3 Chromium fixture tests passed
before the final native-control visibility adjustment (final run pending).
Live SDK smoke: Chrome 155.0.8059.39, 2026-10-18 07:15:24 America/Sao_Paulo,
HTTPS secure context, SDK ready, zero media requests; no receiver selected.

Physical receiver discovery, target playback/codec/CORS/expiry, multi-audio, and
real subtitle acceptance remain unverified. The normal target runtime was not
modified to defeat its anti-debugging. See [handoff](handoff.md) and
[progress](progress.md) for final checks and next actions.
